#### Simple Shell

The ALX software engineering project involves implementing a simple shell, which is a team project. The goal is to develop functionalities similar to those found in the sh shell. This includes features like system navigation, error handling, and command execution.

#### Usage:

- to compile use 
  - ```gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o hsh```
- there are two way to use the shell
    - non interactive mode: ```echo "ls -la" | ./hsh```
    - interactive mode: ```./hsh```
-  we used valgrind to check leaks in our project
   -  ```valgrind ./hsh```
